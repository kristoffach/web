  <div class="panel">
    <p>A player who will chase a fleeing enemy for a long period of time to get the kill. Knowing that a player is a chaser can be valuable since they can be baited away from the point or payload.</p>
  </div>
  <button class="accordion">Cheese/Cheese Comp/Cancer Comp</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Strategies or team compositions that are considered cheap or lazy at low-level, usually because the skill required to counter it is much greater than the skill required to perform it (although it has been pointed out by some commentators that technically, any strategy that does not have this property should never be used). At high level these are rarely used because all players are highly skilled. Here are a few examples:
      Pharmercy (Pharah + Mercy) A team combination of Pharah and Mercy. Pharah flies above shooting rockets while Mercy repeatedly uses Guardian Angel and Angelic Descent to remain in the air while healing or buffing Pharah. Considered cheesy because it is difficult to deal with except by dealing sustained hit-scan damage to an erratically moving target at long range, which can create skill cliffs or lock out heroes that cannot deal long-range hit-scan damage. It also has highly variable effectiveness between console and PC due to the relative difficulty of aiming with a thumbstick as opposed to a mouse (although this also applies to the Pharah)
      Patheon (Symmetra Shields + Brigitte Rally + Torbjorn Armor) This involves putting more health on their team to make them more durable and less likely to get one-shotted.
      Pirate Ship/El Presidente (Bastion + Orisa or Rein Shields + Mercy Damage Boost) This is usually used on payload based maps. It involves the Bastion parking himself on the payload while Orisa/Rein protects him with their shields, along with a Mercy to Damage Boost him. Unlike Pharmercy, this is considered cheesy because of team coordination: the coordination required to perform it is fairly obvious and easily set up even without communication, but defeating this requires a timed flanking attack which needs very precise team co-ordination and can be nearly impossible without comms. A team that trickles (see below) against a Pirate Ship is doomed every time.</p>

  </div>
  <button class="accordion">Deep Strike</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>To pass over/under/through the enemy's defense line and onto the point/payload, forcing some of the enemy team to turn around and deal with you and thus breaking apart the line.</p>

  <button class="accordion">Dive</button>
  <div class="panel">

  <div class="panel">
    <p>A shorthand request from a Mercy player, meaning "go to the edge of the platform you are standing on, so I can see you and use Guardian Angel". Usually ends up being repeated multiple times with increasing frustration, alternating with the "need healing" standard line.</p>

  <button class="accordion">ELO Hell</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Being trapped in a low Competitive rank because you are put in teams with others who drag you down. Possibly a legitimate claim where team cooperation is a problem. Possibly just boasting. From the ELO Rating System used for calculating scores.</p>

  <button class="accordion">EZ</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>It means "Easy", but it's pronounced "Eeez". This is usually said after a one-sided stomp. Or claiming the match was "easy", even when it's clearly a tough match. Which is very annoying to the losing team. It is usually typed with the words "GG". But in Overwatch, it will be filtered out.</p>

  <button class="accordion">Gold Medal Fallacy</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>The belief that because a player has a gold medal in a given stat, indicating they are #1 in their team in that stat, they must be playing well or correctly. Untrue, since a) the team could be bad also, or being sabotaged by their behavior; and b) "trash damage" and other phenomena can distort the stats.</p>
  </div>
  <button class="accordion">GG</button>
  <div class="panel">

  <button class="accordion">Leaver</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>A player who quits a match in the middle. In Casual Play, this is annoying, but the player can be replaced. In Competitive Play this is devastating as it means that either the match
      will be shut down, or one team will have to play the remainder of the match a man short, which will almost certainly mean they lose and suffer full SR loss for doing so.
      (Earlier versions of Overwatch would reduce SR loss as compensation if a team had a leaver, but this resulted in players deliberately leaving, or even being told to leave, when their team was losing.)</p>

  <button class="accordion">Meta</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>"Metagame": the aspects of the game which are more about the relationships between the players than the actual rules of the game. In Overwatch, usually refers to team dynamics.
      Essentially, it's the "game within the game", specifically, looking at how the strength of each hero changes throughout different
      iterations of the game via patches, nerfs, and buffs to heroes, changing the way heroes work with and against each other based on how the developers change the heroes.</p>
  </div>
  <button class="accordion">MMR</button>
  <div class="panel">

    <p>A Tank hero that can't protect their team the way a main tank can, but can still absorb a lot of damage, i.e. D.Va, Roadhog, or Zarya.</p>
  </div>
  <button class="accordion">One Life Rule</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>"On Defense you only get one life." Rule in force at the highest levels of play with highly coordinated teams; a team that can overcome a defensive strategy will likely pick off
      remaining heroes and then 6-hero capture the point, which can happen so quickly that respawning and returning to the point even once can be too slow.</p>
  </div>
  <button class="accordion">One Trick</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>A player who plays only one hero, even if this does not fit in with the requirements of the team. A main complaint against Solo Queue play is that a mismatched team of One Trick players can end up in an unwinnable match.</p>

  </div>
  <button class="accordion">Pick</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>From "pick off" - to kill single critical enemy players in the opposing team, as opposed to winning a fight between entire teams.</p>
  </div>
  <button class="accordion">Pixie</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>For a fast character, typically Tracer, to run around on the point as fast as possible - not prioritizing killing enemies but just being hard to hit
       in order to remain there and contest the point while teammates arise. Also sometimes used for Mercy when using Guardian Angel to quickly move between groups of teammates healing them.
       Rarely, used as a verb for the Guardian Angel ability itself.</p>

  <button class="accordion">Projectile</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Refers to guns which shoot bullets that are visible in the game world and have travel time before it can hit the target, in contrary to Hitscan.
      For example, Pharah's Rocket Launcher, Hanzo's Storm Bow, and Junkrat's Grenade Launcher are projectile weapons, while Soldier 76's and McCree's guns are Hitscan.
      Ana is unusual: her Scoped Shot is hitscan, but her Unscoped Shot is projectile.</p>
  </div>
  <button class="accordion">Pocket</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Usually means a healer who exclusively sticks to just one player and only heals him rather than the whole team.</p>

  </div>
  <button class="accordion">Skill Cap</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>The maximum amount of technical skill that can be expressed playing a given hero. If two players of equal skill playing different heroes duel,
      the hero with the higher skill cap has an advantage because they can express more of their skill before running into the limitations of their hero.

  </div>
  <button class="accordion">Smurf</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>A secondary account created by a player which is deliberately engineered into a lower competitive tier than the player's main account.
      A typical case is in which a group of high level players play together; if one of those players uses a secondary account with an artificially lowered SR,
      the team's average SR will be lower, causing all team members - including those on their main accounts - to gain more SR when they win.</p>
  </div>
  <button class="accordion">Solo Meta</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>The game environment in which each player chooses their own hero without regard to the choices made by other players.
      Usually results in an unusually disjointed game that descends into tragedy-of-the-commons arguments where each player insists someone else should be the one to switch.</p>
  </div>
  <button class="accordion">Solo Queue</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Playing without a group, in Quick or Competitive matches that draw players randomly from a queue. Probably the most common mode of play, but also looked down on by "pro" players
      because of its tendency to limit team tactics.</p>
  </div>
  <button class="accordion">Solo Ult</button>
  <div class="panel">

  <div class="panel">
    <p>1. Having multiple people playing one hero on a team; see Hero stacking.

  <div class="panel">
    <p>Deliberately killing your own hero when most of your team is dead, to ensure that you respawn at the same time as them and can join in the next push without waiting.
      While it may be an option to retreat and wait for your team, killing yourself can be a better option than risking the rest of the enemy team
      hunting you down and killing you separately from anyone else, meaning that the rest of your team must wait for you to respawn or else leave you trickling (see below)</p>

    <p>a) Intentionally attempting to lose a match ("direct throwing"). Sometimes done just to troll, sometimes with a deliberate intent to lower one's own SR,
      and sometimes threatened as an ultimatum to enforce a given team composition.
    <br>b) Choosing not to play seriously in a competitive environment ("indirect throwing") - not trying to lose, but not playing purely to win.
    Usually done because a player is on tilt (below) or has given up. Not considered as unpleasant as direct throwing because it is an understandable consequence of being demoralised,
    but almost as damaging to the play experience for others; especially dangerous because it is infectious.</p>

  <button class="accordion">Tilt</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>From Poker, anger or frustration that damages the quality of a person's play. A player who is angry and playing badly as a result is on tilt or tilted.</p>
  </div>
  <button class="accordion">Trash Damage</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Damage inflicted in a way that does not generate important kills for your team; for example, damage that the opponent immediately heals.
      This creates a misleading Damage stat on the medals screen.</p>
  </div>
  <button class="accordion">Trickling</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>A series of individual players running in one-by-one to an entrenched team and being hopelessly cut down.
      What usually happens if a team is losing and they aren't coordinating properly.</p>
  </div>
  <button class="accordion">Trance</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Zenyatta's Ultimate, Transcendence.</p>

  </div>
  <button class="accordion">Wet Push</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>The logical opposite of a Dry Push: an attack using a large number of ultimates, possibly including a Wombo Combo (below).
      Can be exaggerated as a single that the enemy has used up their ultimates: "that last push was soaking wet".</p>
  </div>
  <button class="accordion">Wombo Combo</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Combining an offensive Ultimate ability with a setup ability. The setup ability is most often Zarya's Graviton Surge, but can apply if the ability is Reinhardt's Earthshatter, Orisa's Halt!, etc.</p>
