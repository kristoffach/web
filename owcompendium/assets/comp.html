          <p>Thanks to reinhardts huge barrier that can protect an entire backline, as well as the devastating potential of a correctly timed Earthshatter.
          He can hold a team together and simultaneously crush an opposing one in a matter of seconds.
          Let’s not forget that he’s got great synergy with the likes of Brigitte and Zarya who’ve also seen a rise in popularity too.
          Their ability to chuck armour and shields his way makes him an even stronger defensive force on the battlefield.</p>
          <br><p>Hanzo got fantastic mobility, coupled with the ability to one-shot a multitude of heroes and it’s extremely difficult to play
          against a Hanzo who’s landing all their shots and scurrying all over the map.
          Despite some nerfs, Junkrat’s still holding strong in the DPS role thanks to his
          immense burst damage that’s perfect for breaking shields and shutting down the frontline</p>
          <br><p>brigitte’s burst onto the competitive scene and she’s a common sight in 90% of our matches. She’s not really much of a healer,
          but she functions amazingly well as an off-tank who provides some additional frontline presence as well as the ability to armour up her allies.
          On top of all this, she synergises well with many shield-based heroes, and can switch from being defensive to stunning an enemy down in the blink of an eye.
          The utility she provides is exceptional and it’s no wonder she occupies the upper echelons of our Overwatch tier list right now. </p>

          she had a huge impact on the meta, she’s definitely struggled to gain the same traction as of late. Mercy, Moira and Zenyatta being better picks with the current crop of strong heroes.

          <p>Zarya’s another tank who’s seen a rise in popularity once again and that’s down to the fact that she compliments Reinhardt and Brigitte so nicely.
          Her bubble shield can soak up damage from meta heroes like Hanzo and Junkrat, which feeds her energy bar really quickly and builds her strong Ultimate ability.
          Zarya’s Ultimate also combos well with Hanzo’s Dragonstrike, Reinhardt’s Earthshatter and many more besides.
          She’s a super flexible pick who’s able to wrench her allies out of danger while increasing her power at the same time.</p>
          <br><p>pharahs mobile, deals high burst damage and pairs up nicely with all the other meta heroes. Tag team her with Mercy and you’ve got a classic combination that forces the enemy into re-thinking their team composition just to deal with you.
          It's a little tempting at first glance to think that Soldier: 76 is just another boring run-and-gun hero - and it's no accident that he's the first character you encounter during the game's tutorial - and yet there's plenty of mastery to be had here despite this surface simplicity. His DPS is very strong, his Sprint ability allows him to get back into the thick of battle nice and quickly, and that group heal can often mean the difference between victory or a rather embarrassing group wipe. He's a solid all-rounder really, and one that shines in skilled hands.</p>
          <br><p>We’re still seeing a lot of Zenyatta as he’s able to counter and compliment what’s strong in the meta right now. His Transcendence is capable of negating a Dragonstrike and Graviton Surge, while his Discord and Healing Orbs are great for both removing vulnerable targets and ensuring allies are safe.</p>

          <p>Ever since she launched, Orisa's struggled to break out of a mid-table position. That came to an end in Season 8 as her ability to constantly throw down shields and hold the frontline began to see the light of day. Now with Season 10 well under way she’s slipped down the rankings, and that’s down to the fact she’s not worth picking over Brigitte who’s currently better in almost every way when it comes to aiding her team.
          Roadhog’s not in the best of places right now and it’s all down to - you guessed it - the rise of the barriers, shields and whatnot. His hook doesn’t have the same devastating potential it once had, and he ends up being more of a bullet sponge that feeds enemy Ultimates if anything.
          Winston once occupied the very highest spot on our tier list during the dive meta. Now he’s come crashing down alongside D.Va, and for pretty much all of the same reasons. He’ll get bursted down quickly if he jumps into the fray, and he doesn’t output enough damage to really pose a threat against the shields, armour and heals that comprise the current meta.</p>
          <br><p>not only does Mei have a whole truckload of annoying crowd-control abilities to frustrate the enemy team with, she can also summon down a massive wall of ice that provides a super-annoying barricade for your future victims to have to deal with. Her excellent, immobilising Ultimate ability does require you to have a team who are savvy enough to capitalise on the opportunity though, so she's by no means a first pick if you're queuing up for a match with randoms.</p>

          <br>
          <p>The entire strategy revolves around Lúcio speed boosting the team to an objective, and Moira keeps everyone alive with healing spray while the tanks absolutely steam roll everything they come in contact with. This composition works extremely well to surprise the opponents, as it's tough to recover once the Slambulance reaches the objective, and everyone is absorbing damage.</p>
